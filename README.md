### Problem Description

Students Project Purdue University Description Narrative  
The concept behind this project you will be creating for the homeless use in Chicago is as follows  

### What we know

- There are many services available to the homeless in Chicago including housing assistance, food, case management, food pantries etc.  
- Most homeless have easy access to GPS enabled mobile phones.  
- Coordination or getting the vast array of what services are available to the homeless based on their location would be a great resource and aide to the homeless.  
- We want this system to be easily updatable.  
- Once a person finds their resource thy need based on their location, would be great to have a way for the homeless person to communicate back to the service provider.  
- The information would be shown on a map of the city either through a google map etc. When a person is in an area, can the service providers information be displayed automatically or by hovering over the area.
